<p>Best Side Dishe to Serve with Fish: Potatoes always make a great side dish no matter how you prepare them—roasted, fried, or mashed. Regardless of how you make them, they taste excellent with white fish like cod or tilapia. Lemon mashed potatoes and rosemary roasted potatoes are two of our favorite potato side dishes with white fish.  When you’re looking for a light and simple side dish full of fiber, you can’t go wrong with a salad. The sweetness of fish like salmon goes well with the bitterness of big leafy vegetables like kale or romaine. Blackened tilapia and other seasoned fish go well with corn and bean salads. Jessica Gavin’s Salmon Greek Salad with Lemon Basil Dressing is a go-to side dish.Pasta pairs well with every kind of seafood from shellfish like lobsters and shrimp to finfish like tilapia and salmon.Flakier fish like fluke, tilapia and flounder cook best on the grill or in the oven when they are wrapped in foil. Pairing these fish with grilled or steam vegetables is a great idea.>Best Side Dishe to Serve with Fish: Potatoes always make a great side dish no matter how you prepare them—roasted, fried, or mashed.
